<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This tutorial outlines the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket. We'll create a few tickets to demonstrate the lifecycle of a ticket within osTicket.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Ticket Lifecycle Stages</h2>

- Intake
- Assignment and Communication
- Working the Issue
- Resolution

<h2>Lifecycle </h2>
1.) Go to http://localhost/osTicket/ and as one of your users (customers) create a ticket. The details are up to you but in my case, I created a general inquiry about equipment and a software issue concerning Adobe.


2.) Go to http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php and log in as one of your users and examine the ticket. 

3.) Assign the ticket's priority, department, SLA, and the agent that will deal with it.

4.) Go to the ticket and "work" the issue at hand. 

5.) Once resolved, set the ticket's status as resolved at the bottom.
